project.

TODO: Remove this section when all TODOs are resolved.

## Getting started

TODO: Document how a developer can get the repository set up for development.

1. Install the version of Node documented in `.node-version`. We recommend using
   [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv) to manage Node versions.

## Running the tests

TODO: Document how a developer can run the tests locally.

## Architecture decision records

We use ADRs to document architecture decisions that we make. They can be found
in `docs/adr` and contributed to with
[adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).

## Access

TODO: Document how people can find the service and its different environments.
